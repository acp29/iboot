%  Bootknife sampling  
%
%  bootstat = bootknife(nboot,bootfun,d)
%  bootstat = bootknife(nboot,bootfun,d1,...,dN)
%
%  bootstat = bootknife(nboot,bootfun,d,...) draws nboot bootknife data
%  resamples and returns the statistic computed by bootfun in bootstat.
%  Bootknife sampling involves creating leave-one-out jackknife samples
%  of size n - 1 and then drawing bootstrap samples of size n with
%  replacement from the jacknife samples [1]. Unlike for the bootstrap, 
%  the variance of bootstat generated by bootknife sampling provides an 
%  unbiased estimate of the sampling variance for small samples. bootfun 
%  is a function handle (e.g. specified with @), or a string indicating 
%  the function name. The third input argument is data (column vector or 
%  a matrix), that is used to create inputs for bootfun. The resampling 
%  method used is balanced resampling [2].
%
%  bootstat = bootknife(nboot,bootfun,d1,...,dN) is as above except that 
%  the third and subsequent numeric input arguments are data vectors 
%  that are used to create inputs for bootfun.
