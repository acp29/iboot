%  Bootknife resampling  
%
%  This function takes a data sample (containing n rows) and uses bootstrap 
%  techniques to calculate a bias-corrected parameter estimate, a standard 
%  error, and 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, the method uses 
%  bootknife resampling [1], which involves creating leave-one-out 
%  jackknife samples of size n - 1 and then drawing samples of size n with 
%  replacement from the jackknife samples. The resampling of data rows is 
%  balanced in order to reduce Monte Carlo error [2,3]. By default, the 
%  algorithm uses a double bootstrap procedure to improve the accuracy of 
%  estimates for small-to-medium sample sizes [4-6].
%
%  stats = bootknife(data)
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot)
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot,bootfun)
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot,bootfun,alpha)
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot,bootfun,alpha,strata)
%  stats = bootknife(data,[2000,200],@mean,0.05,[])    % Default values
%  [stats,bootstat] = bootknife(...)
%  [stats,bootstat] = bootknife(...)
%  [stats,bootstat,bootsam] = bootknife(...)
%
%  stats = bootknife(data) resamples from the rows of a data sample (column 
%  vector or a matrix) and returns a column vector, which from top-to-
%  bottom contains the bootstrap bias-corrected estimate of the population 
%  mean [5,6], the bootstrap standard error of the mean, and calibrated 95% 
%  percentile bootstrap confidence intervals (lower and upper limits) [4]. 
%  Double bootstrap is used to improve the accuracy of the returned 
%  statistics, with the default number of outer (first) and inner (second) 
%  bootknife resamples being 2000 and 200 respectively. For confidence 
%  intervals, this is achieved by calibrating the lower and upper interval 
%  ends to have tail probabilities of 2.5% and 97.5% [4]. 
%
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot) also specifies the number of bootknife 
%  samples. nboot can be a scalar, or vector of upto two positive integers. 
%  By default, nboot is [2000,200], which implements double bootstrap with 
%  the 2000 outer (first) and 200 inner (second) bootknife resamples. 
%  Larger number of resamples are recommended to reduce the Monte Carlo 
%  error, particularly of confidence intervals. If nboot provided is 
%  scalar, the value of nboot corresponds to the number of outer (first) 
%  bootknife resamples, and the default number of second bootstrap 
%  resamples (200) applies. Note that one can get away with a lower number 
%  of resamples in the second bootstrap (to reduce the computational 
%  expense of the double bootstrap) since the algorithm uses linear 
%  interpolation to achieve near asymptotic calibration of confidence 
%  intervals [3]. 
%    Setting the second element of nboot to 0 enforces a single bootstrap 
%  procedure. This can be useful if the purpose is just to get a quick, 
%  unbiased estimate of the bootstrap standard error by bootknife 
%  resampling. However, NaN will be returned for the confidence interval 
%  limits because uncalibrated percentile confidence intervals from a 
%  single bootstrap are considered too inaccurate.
%
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot,bootfun) also specifies bootfun, a function 
%  handle (e.g. specified with @) or a string indicating the name of the 
%  function to apply to the data (and each bootknife resample). The default
%  value of bootfun is 'mean'.
%
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot,bootfun,alpha) where alpha sets the lower 
%  and upper confidence interval ends to be 100 * (alpha/2)% and 100 * 
%  (1-alpha/2)% respectively. Central coverage of the intervals is thus 
%  100*(1-alpha)%. alpha should be a scalar value between 0 and 1. Default
%  is 0.05. If alpha is empty, NaN is returned for the confidence interval
%  ends.
%
%  stats = bootknife(data,nboot,bootfun,alpha,strata) also sets strata, 
%  which are numeric identifiers that define the grouping of the data rows
%  for stratified bootknife resampling. strata should be a column vector 
%  the same number of rows as the data. When resampling is stratified, 
%  the groups (or stata) of data are equally represented across the 
%  bootknife resamples. If this input argument is not specified or is 
%  empty, no stratification of resampling is performed. 
%
%  [stats,bootstat] = bootknife(...) also returns bootstat, a vector of
%  statistics calculated over the (first or outer level of) bootknife 
%  resamples. 
%
%  [stats,bootstat,bootsam] = bootknife(...) also returns bootsam, the  
%  matrix of indices used for bootknife resampling. Each column in bootsam
%  corresponds to one bootknife sample and contains the row indices of the 
%  values drawn from the nonscalar data argument to create that sample.
