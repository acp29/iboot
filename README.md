# statistics-bootstrap

## A statistics package with a variety of bootstrap resampling tools

This package of functions can be used to estimate uncertainty (confidence intervals) and test hypotheses (p-values) using bootstrap. Variations of the bootstrap are included that improve the accuracy of bootstrap statistics for small samples and samples with complex dependence structures. The package is forked from the GitHub repository [iboot](https://github.com/acp29/iboot).

## Installation
pkg install "https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-bootstrap/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
